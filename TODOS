- Environment can be moved to Bind and refactored to be more flexible.
so that instead of looking for NODE_ENV the name of process.env prop can
be user-defined.
- Move EnvOverride to Bind
- when applying Path decorator enforce uniqueness per controller method.
- when applying GET, POST, etc enforce that same method is not already in array.
these 2 enforcements will prevent from doing something like @GET(/'foo') and @POST('/bar')
on the same method. Also will prevent applying @GET('/bar') and @Path('/something') to the same
method

Validation - right now validator returns param | Error
instead return val | Error | Promise<val | Error>
validator signature will be container => context => param => Maybe<Error> | Promise<Maybe<Error>>
allow array of validators per param.
Then run each param validator as Promise.all(validators.map(v => v(param)).then(a => a.find(a instanceof Error))...
Having option to do async validation will open up possibility to use db calls or any network calls for validation
