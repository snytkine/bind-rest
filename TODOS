- Environment can be moved to Bind and refactored to be more flexible.
so that instead of looking for NODE_ENV the name of process.env prop can

- when applying Path decorator enforce uniqueness per controller method.
- when applying GET, POST, etc enforce that same method is not already in array.
these 2 enforcements will prevent from doing something like @GET(/'foo') and @POST('/bar')
on the same method. Also will prevent applying @GET('/bar') and @Path('/something') to the same
method
